# Upgrad Assignment - Eye for Blind - Image Captioner using CNN and RNN Attention Model

## Overview

This repository includes Upgrad capstone project code base, it creates a deep learning model which can explain the contents of an image in the form of speech through caption generation with an attention mechanism on Flickr8K dataset. This kind of model is a use-case for blind people so that they can understand any image with the help of speech. The caption generated through a CNN-RNN model will be converted to speech using a text to speech library. 

This problem statement is an application of both deep learning and natural language processing. The features of an image will be extracted by a CNN-based encoder and this will be decoded by an RNN model.

## Technologies Used

- CNN - CNN is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network with variations of multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing. 
- RNN - RNN unlike feed forward neural networks - can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. CNNs use connectivity pattern between the neurons.
- Tensorflow & Keras - Neural Network library
